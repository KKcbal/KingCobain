    "I remember my team standing meetings well. I want to learn more Java in the future. java is a very versitile coding language and I would love to learn more about it.

I want to learn more Java oriented for game making. making games is fun, and its nice to do little personal projects. it's also a good way to learn the language, and it was how I learned Javascript/Python."
