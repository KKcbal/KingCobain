    "## Question 1 - Pojos and Access Control:\n",
    "Situation: The school librarian wants to create a program that stores all of the books within the library in a database and is used to manage their inventory of books available to the students. You decided to put your amazing code skills to work and help out the librarian!\n",
    "\n",
    "**a. Describe the key differences between the private and public access controllers and how it affects a POJO**\n",
    "\n",
    "Private variables or methods are only accessible from inside the same class. If I had two classes, pooFart1 and pooFart2, and made a private variable Poo in pooFart1, then I could not access variable poo from pooFart2. An object could not have it's data tampered with if it were private. POJOs could be more secure, but you could no longer access them in other classes\n",
    "\n",
    "**b. Identify a scenario when you would use the private vs. public access controllers that isn't the one given in the scenario above**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're making a little game or something, the data stored wouldn't be so important so using public might be more convenient. Public means it's easier to access the variables and you can use them in other classes if needed. If you're working with more sensitive data, like the personal information of a human, than private may be more appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**c. Create a Book class that represents the following attributes about a book: title, author, date published, person holding the book and make sure that the objects are using a POJO, the proper getters and setters and are secure from any other modifications that the program makes later to the objects**\n"

It would probably run when you call it. In a constructor, it will generally just be those lines you would have typed individually without a constructor. It'll be a few ```this.variable = variable```, which would set the value of an variable in the object.\n",
